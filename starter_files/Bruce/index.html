        <div class="company">
          The Copper Gold ratio is commonly referred to as an indicator of the macro economic  environemnt. 
          Using the price relationship of these two metals (copper price / gold price) we can see that higher
          values in the ratio would potentially indicate econcomic growth where lower values would indicate 
          economic contraction. In building upon this idea I explored whether there was a relationship between
          the pricing of the S&P 500 and the Copper Gold ration (CGr) and whether or not we could statistically
          find signals for buying and selling the S&P 500 based on the relationship.

          The original analysis invovled a data visualization to see if changes in the CGr occurred ahead of 
          market moves in the S&P 500. The conclusion was that there were often movements in the ratio ahead of
          market moves. The next step was to explore the numbers a bit deeper to filter out noise and potentially
          identify a true signal of when to buy and or sell the S&P.

          I examined the correlation of the S&P 500 daily price changes to the CGr daily change and mapped out these
          over time in relationship to the their standard deviation over a 55 day rolling period.  The chart above 
          contains "signals" for when the correlation was above or below two standard deviations. The rest of the noise
          was filtered out.
